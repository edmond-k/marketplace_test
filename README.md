Test NFT Marketplace

This is an open decentralized NFT Marketplace built with smart contracts powered by Ethereum. It basically consists in an open platform where each user can mint his own NFT and expose it on a marketplace.

The use case scenario involves the user:
1. Minting the NFT onto the blockchain, after which he is recognized by default as the owner.
2. The user sets a price and lists it on the market
3. Once a buyer purchases the listing, ownership is transferred to the new owner.
